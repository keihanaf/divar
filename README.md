# Divar

A full-stack web application clone of Divar.ir, Iran's popular classified ads platform, built with React.js and Node.js.

## Important Note ⚠️

This is the frontend repository of the Divar clone project. To run the application properly, you need to:

1. Clone and run the backend repository first:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/keihanaf/rjs-divar-api.git
cd rjs-divar-api
npm install
npm start
```

2. The backend server will run on `http://localhost:3400`

3. Then clone and run this frontend repository:

```bash
# Clone the frontend repository
git clone https://github.com/keihanaf/rjs-divar-files.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd rjs-divar

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Without running the backend server (`rjs-divar-api`), the frontend application won't function properly as it depends on the API for all data operations including authentication, posts management, and category operations.
